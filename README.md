# Meta's Llama 2 13B GGML

These files are GGML format model files for [Meta's Llama 2 13B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf).

GGML files are for CPU + GPU inference using [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and libraries and UIs which support this format, such as:
* [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), a powerful GGML web UI with full GPU acceleration out of the box. Especially good for story telling.
* [LoLLMS Web UI](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui), a great web UI with GPU acceleration via the c_transformers backend.
* [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), a fully featured local GUI. Supports full GPU accel on macOS. Also supports Windows, without GPU accel.
* [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), the most popular web UI. Requires extra steps to enable GPU accel via llama.cpp backend.
* [ctransformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers), a Python library with LangChain support and OpenAI-compatible AI server.
* [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python), a Python library with OpenAI-compatible API server.

## Compatibility

### Original llama.cpp quant methods: `q4_0, q4_1, q5_0, q5_1, q8_0`

These are guaranteed to be compatible with any UIs, tools and libraries released since late May. They may be phased out soon, as they are largely superseded by the new k-quant methods.

### New k-quant methods: `q2_K, q3_K_S, q3_K_M, q3_K_L, q4_K_S, q4_K_M, q5_K_S, q6_K`

These new quantisation methods are compatible with llama.cpp as of June 6th, commit `2d43387`.

They are now also compatible with recent releases of text-generation-webui, KoboldCpp, llama-cpp-python, ctransformers, rustformers and most others. For compatibility with other tools and libraries, please check their documentation.

## Explanation of the new k-quant methods
<details>
  <summary>Click to see details</summary>

The new methods available are:
* GGML_TYPE_Q2_K - "type-1" 2-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weight. Block scales and mins are quantized with 4 bits. This ends up effectively using 2.5625 bits per weight (bpw)
* GGML_TYPE_Q3_K - "type-0" 3-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 6 bits. This end up using 3.4375 bpw.
* GGML_TYPE_Q4_K - "type-1" 4-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 8 blocks, each block having 32 weights. Scales and mins are quantized with 6 bits. This ends up using 4.5 bpw.
* GGML_TYPE_Q5_K - "type-1" 5-bit quantization. Same super-block structure as GGML_TYPE_Q4_K resulting in 5.5 bpw
* GGML_TYPE_Q6_K - "type-0" 6-bit quantization. Super-blocks with 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 8 bits. This ends up using 6.5625 bpw
* GGML_TYPE_Q8_K - "type-0" 8-bit quantization. Only used for quantizing intermediate results. The difference to the existing Q8_0 is that the block size is 256. All 2-6 bit dot products are implemented for this quantization type.

**Note**: the above RAM figures assume no GPU offloading. If layers are offloaded to the GPU, this will reduce RAM usage and use VRAM instead.

## How to run in `llama.cpp`

I use the following command line; adjust for your tastes and needs:

```
./main -t 10 -ngl 32 -m llama-2-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin --color -c 2048 --temp 0.7 --repeat_penalty 1.1 -n -1 -p "### Instruction: Write a story about llamas\n### Response:"
```
Change `-t 10` to the number of physical CPU cores you have. For example if your system has 8 cores/16 threads, use `-t 8`.

Change `-ngl 32` to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Remove it if you don't have GPU acceleration.

If you want to have a chat-style conversation, replace the `-p <PROMPT>` argument with `-i -ins`

## How to run in `text-generation-webui`
